Smuggling game set circa ~1500

Overall idea: you operate both parts of the smuggling operation: 1) recruiting, managing and position the on-shore operation 2) Monitoring and purchasing goods from the continent / off shore based on demand in England. 

To do: 
* Implement recruitment mechanic (pygame onClick() actions)
* Demand / price system needs refining so prices go up and down based on market demand
